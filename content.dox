\section intro_sec Introduction

This documentation provides an overview of the project's architecture, modules, and interactions.  It aims to give developers a high-level understanding of the codebase.

\section architecture_sec Architecture Overview

The project follows a modular structure, with distinct modules responsible for specific functionalities. The interactions between these modules are illustrated in the diagram below.

\subsection modules_sec Modules Description

- **clipboard.js:** Manages the "copy to clipboard" functionality for code snippets within the generated documentation.  It dynamically adds copy buttons to code blocks and handles the copy action using the browser's clipboard API.
- **cookie.js:** Provides utility functions for reading, writing, and erasing cookies. This module is used to persist user settings, such as theme preferences.
- **dir_*.js:** (Multiple files) Contain directory structures for the Doxygen-generated documentation. These are automatically generated and describe the file hierarchy.
- **dynsections.js:** Implements dynamic section toggling in the documentation, allowing users to expand and collapse sections of content.
- **codefold**: Handles code folding, allowing users to collapse/expand code blocks.

\subsection interaction_flow Interaction Flow

The following diagram illustrates the general interaction flow and dependencies between the JavaScript modules.

\subsection diagram_elements Diagram Elements

- **rectangle:** Represents a JavaScript module or external library.
- **ES6 Module**: Indicates a module using ES6 import/export syntax.  Although the source code shows the Javascript code to be setting up a Javascript file, the diagram indicates its structure for documentation purposes.
- **(External Library):** Indicate external library, for example JQuery
- **(Browser API):** Indicate APIs provided by a browser to be used by our script.
- **`->`:** Represents a dependency or usage relationship. The arrow points from the module that uses the other module.
- **`label`:** Describes the module and its key features.
