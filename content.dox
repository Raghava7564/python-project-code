\section intro_sec Introduction
This documentation provides an overview of the project's architecture and functionality. It includes diagrams and explanations to help understand the interaction between different modules and components.

\section architecture_sec Project Architecture

The project follows a modular architecture with distinct modules, services, routes, and controllers. The following diagram illustrates the relationship between these components.

digraph G {
    node [shape=box];

    subgraph cluster_modules {
        label = "Modules";
        ModuleA;
        ModuleB;
    }

    subgraph cluster_services {
        label = "Services";
        ServiceX;
        ServiceY;
    }

    subgraph cluster_routes {
        label = "Routes";
        Route1;
        Route2;
    }

    subgraph cluster_controllers {
        label = "Controllers";
        ControllerA;
        ControllerB;
    }

    ModuleA -> ServiceX;
    ModuleA -> ServiceY;
    ModuleB -> ServiceY;
    Route1 -> ControllerA;
    Route2 -> ControllerB;
    ControllerA -> ServiceX;
    ControllerB -> ServiceY;
}
\enddot

\section interaction_sec Interaction Flow

The diagram shows the flow of interaction between different components:

- **Modules**: Represent high-level features or functionalities.
- **Services**: Provide reusable business logic.
- **Routes**: Define API endpoints.
- **Controllers**: Handle incoming requests and interact with services.

1. A request is received by a Route (e.g., Route1).
2. The Route forwards the request to a Controller (e.g., ControllerA).
3. The Controller invokes one or more Services (e.g., ServiceX) to perform the necessary operations.
4. Modules might use services.

\section es6_commonjs_sec ES6 Imports and CommonJS Require

The project supports both ES6 imports and CommonJS require statements for module dependencies. Here's how they are handled:

- **ES6 Imports**:
  ```javascript
  // Example of ES6 import
  import { someFunction } from './moduleA';
  someFunction();
  ```

- **CommonJS Require**:
  ```javascript
  // Example of CommonJS require
  const someModule = require('./moduleB');
  someModule.anotherFunction();
  ```

\section javascript_files JavaScript Files Explanation

- **clipboard.js:** This script adds "copy to clipboard" functionality to code fragments within the generated documentation. It leverages the browser's clipboard API to enable users to easily copy code snippets.
- **cookie.js:**  This file provides helper functions for managing cookies within the documentation website. It allows for reading, writing, and erasing settings stored in cookies, improving user experience and persisting preferences.
- **dir_*.js:** These files are automatically generated by Doxygen and contain directory listings of the source code.  They map directories to their corresponding files, which are used in the documentation navigation structure.
- **dynsections.js:** This script handles the dynamic display and toggling of sections within the generated documentation. It provides functions for expanding and collapsing sections, improving readability and navigation through the documentation.
